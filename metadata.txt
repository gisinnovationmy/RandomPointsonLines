about=The Random Points on Lines... plugin allows users to generate a specified number of random points along selected line layers. It utilizes a user-friendly dialog interface to select the line layer and specify the number of random points. The resulting random points are added as a new temporary layer with additional attributes, including coordinates in both the layer's CRS (XCoord, YCoord) and the project's CRS (CRSXCoord, CRSYCoord), as well as a distance field (Distance) indicating the distance from the start of the line to the point location.

changelog=2.5.0
          - Minor bug fixes and stability improvements.
          - Added compatibility tests for QGIS 3.40 running on Qt6.
          
          2.0.0
          - Major changes in the interface of the plugin.
          - Introduced advanced features, including offset settings and point generation with random seed options.
          - Improved plugin documentation.
          - Updated dialog title from "Generate Random Points Along Lines" to "Random Points Along Line".

          1.0.2
          - Enhanced the description, about and documentation of the plugin.
          - Added both the layer's CRS (XCoord_, YCoord_) and the project's CRS (XCoordProjCRS, YCoordProjCRS), along with a distance field (Distance) that shows the distance from the start of the line to each point. The points are customized for clearer visualization, with a size of 2.3 and a red color.
          - Renamed the dialog title from "Random Points on Lines..." to "Generate Random Points Along Lines".
          - Added columns for ID and Distance after generating random points for the selected line layers, where ID is a unique identifier for each data attribute.

          1.0.1 
          - Combined all plugins into a single toolbar created by GIS Innovation Sdn. Bhd.
          - Enhanced the toggle feature so that clicking the button or 'X' will also turn off the toggle in the toolbar.
          - Set the first checkable layer in the layers panel as the default layer.
          - Corrected the plugin name from "Random Point on Lines..." to "Random Points on Lines...".

          1.0.0 
          - Initial release of the plugin.
